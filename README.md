# python-refresher
My submission for the Python Refresher Assignment (Assignment 2)

The goal was to use good practices to create a project that would calculate the total $CO_2$ emissions from fires in the US (which could be extended to any other statistic in the dataset for any other country)

## Installation and Usage
Clone the GitHub Repository and run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
$ bash run.sh
```
This will print the total emissions from forest fires in the US for the range of data provided in the data source

## Data Source
The data source was the provided `Agrofood_co2_emission.csv` file. This datafile provides information on Carbon Dioxide emissions by country and year. The level of $CO_2$ emissions are given in units of [kilotons]
